# Twitter Sentiment Transformer

### About
In this project, I will be utilizing Hugging Face's DistilBERT encoder architecture to train a sentiment classification model on twitter tweets. This model will allow for large scale decision making and marketing by analyzing sentiment amongst thousands of tweets. This model has a **96.5%** accuracy when tested on 1000 samples. At the end of the notebook, I demonstrate how to use this model to predict Amazaon tweet sentiments as a use-case.
